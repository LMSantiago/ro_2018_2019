	\subsection{Introduction}

	The goal of this project is to simulate a Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
	transmission system with M points in the constellation diagram (M-QAM) and to
	perform a Bit Error Rate (BER) measurement that can be compared with theoretical
	and experimental values.
	M-QAM systems can encode $\log_2 M$ bits per symbol which means they can
	transmit higher data rates keeping the same bandwidth. However, because the states are closer together, these
	systems require a higher signal-to-noise ratio.
	The Bit Error Rate (BER) is a measurement of how a bit stream is altered by a
	transmission system due to noise or intersymbol interference.

	For $M=4$ the M-QAM system can be reduced to a Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
	system (QPSK) system that uses four equispaced points in the constellation
	diagram, as shown in figure \ref{fig:const_2m} where a Gray encoding is
	assumed~\cite{proakis08}.

	\subsection{Open Issues}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The DSP used to process the lab data needs to be implemented in the NetXPTO platform, as it is currently
			implemented in MATLAB.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Currently under development.
		\end{itemize}
		\item It is necessary to implement a way to open external signals from
			the oscilloscope on the netXPTO platform.
		\item There are still differences between the data produced in the simulation
			and the data measured in the Lab.
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Future work}
	Extend this block to include other values of M.
